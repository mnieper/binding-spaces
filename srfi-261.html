<h2 id="status">Status</h2>

<p style="color: red;">For editor's use only.  Please do not edit this section.</p>

<p>??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>The concept of binding spaces is introduced. Each identifier cannot
only have a binding in the default binding space, e.g. as a variable,
a keyword, a pattern variable or a record name, but simulateneously
also in other binding spaces. This allows to give an identifier
meanings depending on the context in which the identifier is
used. This can be used to implement DSLs, type systems, and otherwise
rich macros.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>The names of the syntax and procedures are subject to changes.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>
  Each identifier binding belongs to a <dfn>binding space</dfn>.  The
  identifier bindings described in the R<sup>n</sup>RS belong to the
  <dfn>default binding space</dfn>.  Bindings belonging to other
  binding spaces are called <dfn>secondary bindings</dfn>.  A binding
  shadows only bindings belonging to the same binding space.  An
  indentifier can only have secondary binding if it is also bound in
  the default binding space.
</p>

<p>An identifier can be imported with the same local name from two or
  more libraries or for two or more levels from the same library only
  if the binding exported by each library is the same for each binding
  space.
</p>

<p>Unless otherwise said, definitions and binding constructs bind
  identifiers in the default binding space.</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b><code>define-binding-space</code></b> &lt;binding space&gt; [<var>&lt;guard expression&gt;</var>]</p>

<p>The <code>define-binding-space</code> form is a &lt;definition&gt;.</p>

<p>Binds &lt;binding space&gt; to a newly created binding space, a
  kind of syntax.  If &lt;guard expression&gt; is present, it is
  evaluated at expand-time to yield a <var>guard procedure</var>,
  which is then associated with the binding space.  It is an assertion
  violation if the &lt;guard expression&gt; does not evaluate to a
  procedure.
</p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b><code>define-binding-in</code></b> <var>&lt;binding space&gt;</var> <var>&lt;identifier&gt;</var> <var>&lt;expression&gt;</var></p>

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b><code>resolve-binding-in</code></b> <var>&lt;binding-space&gt;</var> <var>&lt;identifier-expression&gt;</var> [<var>&lt;default expression&gt;</var>]

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b><code>define-export-set</code></b> <var>&lt;identifier&gt;</var>
  (<var>&lt;binding-space&gt;</var> <var>&lt;exported-identifier&gt;</var> &hellip;) &hellip;

<p><u>Syntax:</u> <b><code>import-bindings</code></b> <var>&lt;import-bindings&gt;</var> <var>&lt;export-set&gt;</var> &hellip;

<p><u>Procedure:</u> <b><code>make-binding-space-transformer</code></b> <var>procedure</var>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>This SRFI is accompanied by a
mostly-portable <a href="binding-spaces.sls">sample
implementation</a>.  It depends on the special
forms <code>define-property</code>, <code>meta</code>,
and <code>quote-syntax</code> found in Chez Scheme.</p>

<p>The <code>define-property</code> form is also available
  through <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-213/srfi-213.html">SRFI
  213</a>. The <code>meta</code> form is used to deal with phasing in
  R6RS. The <code>quote-syntax</code> is used in non-essential ways.

<p>The author was inspired by typical use cases of identifier
  properties as defined by Chez Scheme and by Racket's solution through
  binding spaces.
